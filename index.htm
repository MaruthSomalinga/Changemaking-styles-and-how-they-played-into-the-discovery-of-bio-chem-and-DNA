<h1>Changemaking styles, and how they played into the discovery of bio-chem and DNA<h1/> 
    <h2>Builders</h2>

    <p1>Builders create change through engineering and building, they are smart and innovative.</p1>

    <h2>Networkers</h2>

    <p2>Networkers create change through connecting people and groups to inform and educate and gather help for the cause.</p2>
  
  <h2>Nurturers</h2>

    <p3> Nurturers create change by providing energy to all changemakers and by insprirng them.</p3>
  
  <h2>Resisters</h2>

    <p4> Resisters create change by being the frontlines to changemaking, being brave and making an impact is what they do.</p4>

    <h2>Communicators</h2>

    <p5>Communicators create change by sharing knowledge and make it easy to understade and also very acessciable so everyone can know the truth.</p5>
  
  <h2>Investigators</h2>

    <p6>Investigators create change by researching the problem and potential solutions.</p6>
  
  <h1> How changemaking connects to the discovery of DNA</h1>

    <p6>James Watson, Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin contributed to the discovery of DNA's helical structure. This discovery took a while to be fully understood, Oswald Avery proved that the nucleic acid DNA carries genectic information, but nobody could understand it. Two groups of people were working on figuring out the structure of DNA, Watson and Francis were one group and the other was Franklin and Wilkins. Both groups collided when Franklins parter Wilkins showed Watson a piece of Franklins work called exposure 51, without her knowledge. After this knowledge Watson proposed that the DNA structure was made up of 2 nucleic acids winding up and down. They published this work in April 1953. They later received a nobel prize for their work, but Franklin was not credited. The changemaking style "builders" ties into this story because Franklin built up the x-ray that displayed the shawdow of the structure.The changemaking style "networkers" ties into this story because Cambridge university was the place where the idea of the structuer spread. The changemaking style "Nurturers" ties into this story because Wilkins was the one who told Watson about the discovery helping them. The changemaking style "Resisters" ties into this story because Franklin could have fought back and also gotten a noble prize but unfortunatly she was dead and was not able to. The changemaking style "communicators" ties into this story because Watson and Crick published a book on DNA and spread the word. The changemaking style "investigator" ties into this story because everyone was investigating and theorizing ideas on what the structure of DNA was.</p6>
